![This is me][1]

I'm an applied microeconomist with a focus on behavioral and experimental economics. In my research I combine theory and experimental evidence to structure and guide analysis. My interests are quite varied: in the past, I have worked on

* the interaction between concerns for animal welfare and prosocial behavior towards human beings ([it's positive](/doc/AnimalWelfareAndHumanEthics.pdf)) 
* understanding when customer-driven pricing mechanisms work ([it depends...](/doc/DelegatingPricingPowerToCustomers.pdf)) 
* examining whether context influences decision making in a speed dating experiment ([it does](/doc/ContextDependenceInSpeedDating.pdf)).

In other capacities, I like to travel, cook, brew beer, read, and most importantly play the bassoon and contrabassoon. I'm actively participating in several orchestras in Munich (though not always at the same time...): the [Munich International Orchestra](http://www.mio-home.de), the [Symphony Orchestra Munich Andechs](http://www.s-o-m-a.de), and the [Blutenburg Kammerphilharmonie](http://www.bkpm.de). I'm also one of the founding members of aulos klangakademie e.V., which organizes an annual one-week choir and orchestra camp.

#### Education

I am currently employed at the University of Munich, where I have been a research and teaching assistant at the chair of [Prof. Dr. Klaus M. Schmidt](http://www.et.econ.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professor/schmidt/index.html) for the past three and a half years. I'm expecting to receive my doctorate in economics in May 2017.

Prior to that, I completed my M.Sc. at the University of Munich, and my B.A. at the University of St. Gallen. Please find my detailed CV [here](/doc/CV_FlorentinKraemer.pdf).
