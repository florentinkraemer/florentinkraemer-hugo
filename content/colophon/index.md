This website has been generated using [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io), a fast static website generator. It uses a template by [bootstrapious.com](https://bootstrapious.com/), ported to Hugo by [Kishan B](https://github.com/kishaningithub).

It runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the excellent [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/) in the background. The entire code for building this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/florentinkraemer).

Getting this site up and running is due to a combination of two great tutorials by [Robert Myles McDonell](http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/) and [Amber Thomas](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/).
